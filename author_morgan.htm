        <font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Arthur Morgan was born near
        Cincinnati, Ohio, but his family soon moved to St. Cloud, Minnesota,
        where he grew up. His father was an engineer, and his own interests
        leaned in that direction. Very early in his life he seems to have had a
        concern for social improvement for when he was just ten years old he was
        publishing great quotations for human uplift on a regular basis in one
        of the St. Cloud newspapers. In 1895, at the age of seventeen, he
        experienced a vivid vision of an ideal community while walking home
        through the woods. The Utopian dream of an ideal society was thereafter
        to direct his steps for the rest of his life.</font>
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        <font face="Century Gothic" size="2">After graduating from high school
        he left home, at the age of nineteen and spent the next three years
        doing many kinds of outdoor work, mostly in Colorado, finding that there
        was a real dearth of understanding of hydraulic engineering. Then he
        returned home, reading and studying problems relating to hydraulics, and
        began to practice engineering with his father, learning his profession
        in the old-fashioned way, from the ground up, by apprenticeship.</font> <font size="2">He
        married and had three children, Ernest, Griscom and Frances, each of
        whom would later have a distinguished career centered on some aspect of
        human service.</font>
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        <font face="Century Gothic" size="2">At the age of 32, he founded his
        own engineering company, and three years later, after a disastrous flood
        had practically wiped out the city of Dayton, Ohio, he was called to
        take full charge of the Miami River Flood Control Project, involving the
        building of several huge dams. This work he did so well as to be set on
        the road to worldwide engineering fame.</font>
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        <font face="Century Gothic" size="2">In 1919 Arthur Morgan was appointed to the Board of Antioch College, a
        dying institution in Yellow Springs, Ohio, a moribund village some
        eighteen miles from Dayton. He saw Antioch and Yellow Springs as a kind
        of double opportunity to test out his higher educational ideas and his
        concepts for community development. He was made President, and there
        began a thrilling experiment in innovative higher education; an emphasis
        was upon becoming a well rounded, whole man or woman dedicated to the
        welfare of humanity.</font>
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        <font face="Century Gothic" size="2">In fifteen years Arthur Morgan
        built up Antioch College to where it was ranked among the top three
        colleges of the nation in a study by the Carnegie Corporation.</font>
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        <font face="Century Gothic" size="2">In 1933, Arthur Morgan was called
        by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to initiate and head the vast
        development project known as the Tennessee Valley Authority, at that
        time the greatest effort at regional development of natural resources
        and human beings ever attempted in the history of the world.&nbsp;</font>
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        <font face="Century Gothic" size="2">It was during this same period of
        intense preoccupation with the TVA and its victories and disappointments
        that he finished a lifelong work on a biography of the great Utopian of
        the nineteenth century, Edward Bellamy, and discovered connections
        between Utopian writings and actual ideal societies. This led to his
        landmark volume entitled, <i>Nowhere Was Somewhere</i>.</font>
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        <font face="Century Gothic" size="2">Upon his return to Yellow Springs
        in 1939, Arthur Morgan turned his thought and energy to the problem of
        revitalizing America's small communities, the &quot;Seedbed of
        Society&quot; and the garden in which human character is grown. It was a
        return to an old love, for he had already built model villages in Ohio
        and Tennessee and sparked a successful &quot;intentional&quot; community
        in North Carolina. He had been the moving force transforming the village
        of Yellow Springs from a moribund little hamlet to an exciting and
        vibrant ideal community in which people wanted to live. He succeeded
        beyond his own modest hopes, and Yellow Springs today is a monument to
        his vision and idealism.</font>
