<b><i>Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice and 21st Century
Potential,</i></b> by Gene Sharp, <a href="author_sharp.htm">Extending
Horizons Books</a>, 2005.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">In
January 1991, as the world's attention was entirely on Iraq, Kuwait and the
U.S., Gene Sharp, elder scholar on nonviolent power, was invited to Latvia,
where the collapsing Soviet state was engaging in brutal oppression of Latvian
independence demonstrators. The people established a parallel government, which
brought Sharp in to consult as nonviolent demonstrators were getting killed by
the infamous Soviet-backed Black Beret security forces. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Gene
Sharp has been around the nonviolent block more than anyone I've heard of. The
Baltic states, Burma, South Africa, China during the invasion of troops into
Tiananmen Square, and many other hotspots before, during and after climactic,
power-changing moments of struggle.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">He
has seen nonviolence succeed more than he has seen it fail—and how many
leaders of overmatched military forces can say that about the forces they
advise? Overmatched, did I say? Apparently, not usually. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">With
the exceptions of China and, so far, Burma, nonviolence has won the day against
heavily armed, practicing despots.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">This
is the most comprehensive work produced by Gene Sharp and his associates at the
premier institute for the study of nonviolent power, the Albert Einstein
Institution at Harvard. His associates include a former military officer and
many other real-life conflict managers, as well as researchers.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">For
the student of nonviolence, this is a mandatory volume, full of stories and
theory, tactics and political exegesis.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman">Sharp
knows his material more thoroughly than anyone, and he has recruited the best
colleagues. I recall talking to him at our hotel at a conference several years
ago, asking if he might ever be open to my sending a student researcher his way.
He shook his head. &quot;Probably not. Any student I might take on would need to
be extraordinarily gifted and disciplined.&quot; This is likely his last book.
It is just the thing for the gifted and disciplined student of nonviolence, 550
pages of solid helpful information, enough to provide the foundations for
nonviolent revolution.</font></span></p>
