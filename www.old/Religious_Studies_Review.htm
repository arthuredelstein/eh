<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><i>WAGING NONVIOLENT STRUGGLE: 20TH CENTURY
PRACTICE AND 21ST CENTURY POTENTIAL. </i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">For more than three decades Sharp's work has
been indispensable reading for scholars of and activists for nonviolent social
change. His books and pamphlets have been translated into dozens of languages,
and have served as &quot;how to&quot; manuals in many recent nonviolent
struggles. This book summarizes his long path-breaking career. Twenty-seven case
studies of twentieth-century nonviolent movements, with all degrees of success
and failure, illustrate the breadth of the use of nonviolent tactics: the Indian
independence movement; resistance to Nazi rule; opposition to dictatorships in
Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa; the American civil rights movement; and
the breakup of Communist rule in Eastern Europe. In most cases the use of
nonviolent means was almost accidental. Sharp argues for the potential of
nonviolent strategies and tactics to change dramatically how people struggle for
justice, and thereby change social and political relationships and structures,
if they are studied and analyzed at the same depth military strategists such as
Sun Tzu, Clausewitz and L. Hart have studied how to wage violent war. Although
he mentions it only in passing toward the end of this masterful book, key to
Sharp's argument is that he discusses nonviolent struggle, not the moral or
religious justifications for nonviolence. One need not have an ideological or
theological commitment to &quot;nonviolence&quot; in the abstract to use
nonviolent tactics in one's work for social change. Thus this book will be a
useful addition to courses that do have such a philosophical or theological
focus, as well as serving as a practical bible for the next generation of
nonviolent activists.</span></p>
