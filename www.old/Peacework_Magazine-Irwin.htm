<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Imagine a country (this may not be
difficult) where the regime is corrupt and hypocritical, has seized power
illicitly, yet seems firmly entrenched. It strives to keep its people
frightened, distracted, and misinformed, but anyone can plainly see economic,
ecological, military, health, resource, and social disasters unfolding. Can a
small group appeal to the public’s interests and ideals, revive hopes, and
awaken the people power needed to force crucial changes?</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">If there is a way to do it, many of
the clues to finding it may be contained in this book.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Sharp is a remarkably single-minded
and hopeful person. Decades after many people have laid aside whatever youthful
idealism they had, Sharp still affirms, “if understood accurately and applied
intelligently, wisely, and courageously, this alternative type of struggle …
offers great hope for a better future for our world.” Hopefulness tends to
vary with temperament. But Gene Sharp’s research provides solid evidence and
reasoning that can sustain realistic hope for persons of any temperament.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Waging Nonviolent Struggle</i> is
an indispensable work. It is an up-to-date guide and a gateway to other valuable
resources. Clear organization (and a detailed index) make this book
“consultable” as well as readable, and at $14.95 it is very reasonably
priced. When it comes to nonviolent struggle, Sharp does not have all the
answers; but you can find more of them by starting with his writings than any
other way I know.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The hope and energy Sharp’s
success stories can renew is only one of at least four reasons to read his new
book. Another is that it will help us understand world events of recent years:
how Slobodan Milosevic was overthrown in Serbia in 2000 by people power (after
NATO bombing had failed), and how that success is related to later victories in
former Soviet Georgia and Ukraine—and perhaps others to come. Third, we
encounter facts, ideas, and arguments that can help us argue more persuasively
against war with friends, family, acquaintances, and opponents. Finally, we
learn methods for defending freedom, thwarting election theft, and struggling
toward a better world. Lest we fall victim to naïve optimism, we also learn the
pitfalls that have often made past struggles fail.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><i>Waging Nonviolent Struggle</i>
brings together, in comparatively compact form, many of the arguments and
analyses from the vast corpus of Sharp’s decades of research. The reader new
to Sharp’s work will find the gist of it here, with adequate detail, but also
guidance for how to pursue many topics in greater depth. Those who have read one
or more of Sharp’s previous books and feel familiar with his approach will
find here no mere restatement, but instead a provocative program for world
social improvement enriched by new historical experience and analysis.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">In the first of its four parts,
Sharp presents, in less than 50 pages, the key ideas from his earlier works, <i>The
Politics of Nonviolent Action</i> (1973) and <i>Social Power and Political
Freedom</i> (1980): the concept of nonviolent struggle, a theory of political
power, a program for replacing political violence by nonviolent struggle, and a
vision of how this could make possible the overcoming of four “grave
problems”: dictatorship, genocide, war, and social oppression. This concisely
provides the core of Sharp’s unique perspective.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The conciseness continues. Where <i>The
Politics of Nonviolent Action</i> (still in print in paperback) features 300
pages presenting countless examples illustrating 198 methods of nonviolent
action, the new book, in contrast, simply lists the methods in sixteen pages,
with only a few paragraphs of commentary interspersed. The obvious loss of
historical detail here is, however, partly compensated for by <i>Waging
Nonviolent Struggle</i>’s second part.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Making up nearly half the book, Part
Two presents twenty-three cases of “Improvised Nonviolent Struggles in the
Twentieth Century.” Several are well-known “classic” cases: Gandhi’s
Salt March, the Montgomery bus boycott, Czechoslovakia’s 1968 resistance to
the Soviet invasion. But the majority focus on events from 1971 onward.
Poland’s Solidarity in the 1980s, the people power uprising in the
Philippines, and Tiananmen Square are, of course, included, but so also are
cases from Argentina, Burma, Namibia, and South Africa, and the defeat of the
1991 coup attempt against Gorbachev. A majority of the cases are credited to
close colleagues and topic experts, and include short bibliographies permitting
them to be used as starting points for student assignments or personal study.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Part Three, “The Dynamics of
Nonviolent Struggle,” closely parallels the similarly titled final part of <i>The
Politics of Nonviolent Action</i> (but is compressed from about 370 to about 70
pages). The first chapters’ titles are unchanged and self-explanatory:
“Laying the Groundwork for Nonviolent Action,” “Challenge Brings
Repression,” and “Solidarity and Discipline to Fight Repression.”</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The next chapter, “Political
Ju-Jitsu” (the surprising shift of power <i>away from</i> the wielders of
violence that may occur when they apply it against people maintaining nonviolent
discipline), has become “Noncooperation and Political Ju-Jitsu.” Sharp now
emphasizes that mass noncooperation—the withholding of purchasing, or labor,
or compliance with orders—has the “predominant impact” (404), compared
with political ju-jitsu. This shift indirectly responds to the occasional
question, “What if the opponent <i>does not</i> behave so repressively as to
weaken his power position?” To the extent that the opponent is dependent on
the grievance group, the latter’s noncooperation can still be powerful.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Finally, 1973’s “Three Ways
Success May Be Achieved” have now become four. One way is the “conversion”
of the opponent to one’s own point of view. However, Sharp avers,
“nonviolent struggle almost never succeeds by melting the hearts of
opponents” (511). Sometimes, success comes through nonviolent coercion—when
defiance and noncooperation are so widespread that the opponents are incapable
of maintaining or imposing their desired policies. Probably the most common
outcome arises through accommodation, where opponents decide to give in to some
degree, even though they have neither changed their minds nor lost all other
options. The new, fourth mechanism Sharp has added is “disintegration”—a
collapse of the regime’s power so complete that “no coherent body remains”
(419) that could even acknowledge defeat.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">For those well acquainted with
Sharp’s previous books, the most valuable part of <i>Waging Nonviolent
Struggle</i> is likely to be Part Four. Together with an appendix on
“Preparing a Strategic Estimate for Nonviolent Struggle,” it amounts to more
than 100 pages devoted to both a broad overview of how nonviolent struggle can
be made more effective and applied to major problems of the modern world, and
detailed guidelines for analyzing and strategizing for any particular local,
national, or global issue. While Sharp has always insisted on the importance of
strategy, this book offers more material to aid future struggles.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">In 1989, activist writer Brian
Martin opined, “Arguably, Sharp has a higher profile among grassroots social
activists than any other living political theorist.” Whether true or not then,
his influence has since been conspicuously rising.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">One striking example is conveyed in
a footnote to the case account of Latvia, which regained independence from the
Soviet Union in 1991, despite Gorbachev’s rejection of its declaration of
independence the year before. In November 1989, a Lithuanian philosopher
obtained page proofs of Sharp’s <i>Civilian-Based Defense: A Post-Military
Weapons System</i> (1990) and sent them to the Director General of his
country’s Department of National Defense, who in turn sent out 50 photocopies
to people across the Soviet Union, including Latvia and Estonia.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The Latvian government commissioned
a translation and used it to plan their republic’s defense against possible
large-scale Soviet attack. As pressure increased, including physical attacks on
individuals by Soviet agents, the Popular Front of Latvia announced in December
1990 a program of nonviolent resistance to any coup, military rule, or imposed
governor.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">As new Soviet forces moved into the
Baltics in January, with killings in Lithuania, Latvian leaders mobilized
500,000 civilians to protect their parliament and communications centers.
Despite Soviets’ killing six Latvians in the following week, the people
refrained from a violent response, knowing it would only provide an excuse for
larger military intervention.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">When hard-liners sought to oust
Gorbachev in August 1991 and simultaneously moved troops into Latvia’s
capital, the recently established “Nonviolent Defense Center” distributed
2000 copies of resistance instructions to Latvia’s cities and villages. The
hard-liners’ coup collapsed in the face of widespread resistance, and two
weeks later Latvia achieved full independence. “Nonviolent national defense”
and “civil disobedience” were subsequently officially declared part of
Latvia’s defense program. Nor is this result of a struggle unique: after
Thailand’s 1992 defeat of a military coup, its 1997 constitution granted
citizens “the right to employ nonviolent resistance against future coups
d’etat” (paraphrase; 313).</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Sharp has spoken of the “mousetrap
theory”: invent a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your
door. Today that process is visibly under way. The number of languages into
which at least an article (and often a booklet or book) by Sharp has been
translated has doubled (to 32!) over the past two decades and availability of
translations on the Web has mushroomed. As I write, the Albert Einstein
Institution has announced that Sharp’s “From Dictatorship to Democracy,”
currently available in Arabic, Azeri, Farsi, Serbian, Spanish, and Ukrainian,
among others (see <a href="http://www.aeinstein.org">www.aeinstein.org</a>), is
now available for free download in its fourteenth language: Chinese.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Sharp was invited to advise the
students in Tiananmen Square, but too late to help them modify their high-risk
strategy and tactics (he arrived on the very eve of the massacre). Years later,
a mid-level leader from Tiananmen, reading about nonviolent struggle, exclaimed
“Why didn’t we know this in 1989?”</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">The spread of the vital knowledge of
nonviolent struggle now proceeds from multiple sources. (It is no one-person
show, though a book review cannot survey it.) Georgian regime opponents invited
Serbian Otpor (“Resistance”) trainers to teach them the lessons from
overthrowing Milosevic. The Serbians brought the video documenting their
campaign, “Bringing Down a Dictator” (which includes a close-up of the cover
of one of Sharp’s books they consulted), and later it aired on Georgia’s
non-government TV network twice; the next week the regime was toppled.
Ukrainians read “From Dictatorship to Democracy,” and the rest is … not
only “history,” but the future. The project of dubbing that video into
Arabic, French, Russian, Spanish, and Chinese is already in progress (see <a href="http://www.aforcemorepowerful.org"><span style="color:windowtext">www.aforcemorepowerful.org</span></a>).</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">For the discouraged, the evident
hand of the US government in aiding opposition to disfavored regimes (in Georgia
and Ukraine, for example) may be “what’s wrong with this picture.”
Realists, however, know the future may improve on the past, and that even
largely nefarious US policies may have multiple motives, internal
contradictions, and unanticipated consequences.</p>
<p style="margin:0pc;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>

<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;
mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">After defeats in 1970 and 1976, Polish activists
refined their strategy and objectives and at the next opportunity, in 1980,
launched the process that in a decade changed the map of Europe. How much more
will the Chinese know about strategy and objectives the next time historical
opportunity knocks on their door? US activists undaunted by defeats since 2000
should ask themselves some big questions—and study this essential book.</span>
