debunk common myths concerning the practice. Such myths include the contention
that nonviolence is ineffective against dictatorships and genocide, or that
nonviolent methodologies rely upon an appeal to the moral character of the
opponent (in fact, nonviolent coercive techniques such as economic boycott and
social noncompliance have an impact regardless of the humanitarian stature of
the regime in question).<o:p>

because nonviolent methodologies have the potential to bring successful results
at a lower overall mortality rate than violent methodologies, and uninvolved
third parties (a.k.a. &quot;innocent civilians&quot;) are less likely to suffer
collateral damage. Scrutinized case studies, overviewed and documented by a
variety of different researchers, range from a successful protest of German
women in Berlin to save their Jewish husbands (who had intermarried) from
deportation and execution during World War II; the 1989 student uprising in
China that ended in a tragic massacre; the successful defense of democracy in
Thailand after a long succession of military coups; the successful removal of
genocidal dictator Slobodan Milosevic from power in Serbia; and much more.<o:p>

addition,<i> <b>Waging Nonviolent Struggle</b>  </i> offers a &quot;handbook&quot;
concerning how to coordinate nonviolent resistance with an eye on practical
