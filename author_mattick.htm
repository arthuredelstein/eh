      <p align="justify"><font size="2">Born in Pomerania in 1904 and raised in
      Berlin by class- conscious parents, Mattick was already at the age of 14 a
      member of the Spartacists' Freie Sozialistiche Jugend. In 1918 he started
      to learn as a toolmaker at Siemens, where he was also elected as the
      apprentices' delegate on the workers' council of the company during the
      German revolution.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">Implicated in many actions during the
      revolution, arrested several times and threatened with death, Mattick
      radicalized along the left and oppositional trend of the German
      communists. After the ‘Heidelberg’ split of the KPD (Spartacus) and
      the formation for the KAPD in the spring of 1920, he entered the KAPD and
      worked in the youth organization Rote Jugend, writing for its journal.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">In 1921, at the age of 17, Mattick moved to Cologne to find work with
      Klockner for a while, until strikes, insurrections and a new arrest
      destroyed every prospect of employment. He was active as an organizer and
      agitator in the KAPD and the AAU in the Cologne region, where he got to
      know Jan Appel among others. Contacts were also established with
      intellectuals, writers and artists working in the AAUE founded by Otto
      Ruhle.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">With the continuing decline of radical mass struggle and revolutionary
      hopes - especially after 1923 - and having been unemployed for a number of
      years, Mattick emigrated to the United States in 1926, whilst still
      maintaining contacts with the KAPD and the AAU in Germany.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">In the USA Mattick carried through a more systematic theoretical study,
      above all of Karl Marx. In addition, the publication of Henryk Grossmann's
      principal work, Das Akkumulations - and Zusammenbruchsgesetz des
      Kapitalistischen Systems (1929), played a fundamental role for Mattick, as
      Grossmann brought Marx's theory of accumulation, which had been completely
      forgotten, back to the centre of debate in the workers' movement. To
      Mattick Marx’s ‘critique of political economy’ became not a purely
      theoretical matter but rather directly connected to his own revolutionary
      practice. From this time Mattick focused on Marx’s theory of capitalist
      development and its inner logic of contradictions inevitably growing to
      crisis as the foundation of all political thoughts with the workers’
      movement.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">Towards the end of the 1920’s Mattick had moved to Chicago, where he
      first tried to unite the different German workers' organizations. In 1931
      he tried to revive the Chicagoer Arbeiterzeitung, a newspaper steeped in
      tradition and at one time edited by August Spies and Joseph Dietzgen, but
      without success. For a period he joined the Industrial Workers of the
      World, who were the only revolutionary union organization existing in
      America which, in spite of national or sectoral differences, assembled all
      workers in One Big Union, so as to prepare the general strike to bring
      down capitalism. However, the golden age of the Wobblies' militant strikes
      had already passed by the beginning of the `thirties, and only the
      emerging unemployed movement again gave the IWW a brief regional
      development. In 1933 Paul Mattick drafted a programe for the IWW trying to
      give the Wobblies a more solid ‘marxist’ foundation based on
      Grossman’s theory, although it did not improve the organization's
      condition.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">After some unsuccessful attempts to exercise an influence from the outside
      on the Leninist United Workers Party, Mattick finally founded a council
      communist group in 1934 with some friends who were originally from the IWW
      as well as with some expelled members of the UWP. The group kept close
      contacts with the remaining small groups of the German/Dutch left
      communism in Europe and published the journal International Council
      Correspondence, which up though the 30’ies became a Anglo-American
      parallel to the Rätekorrespondenz from the Dutch GIC(H). Articles and
      debates from Europe were translated along with economic analysis and
      critical political comments of current issues in the US and elsewhere in
      the world.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">Apart from his own factory work, Mattick organized not only most of the
      review's technical work but was also the author of the greater part of the
      contributions which appeared in it. Among the few willing to offer regular
      contributions was Karl Korsch, with whom Mattick had come into contact in
      1935 and who remained a personal friend for many years from the time of
      his emigration to the United States at the end of 1936.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">As the European ‘council communism’ went underground and formally
      ‘dissapeared’ in the second halt of the 30’ies Mattick let the
      ‘Correspondence’ change name - from 1938 to Living Marxism, and from
      1942 to New Essays.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">Through Karl Korsch and Henryk Grossman Mattick also had some contact to
      Horkheimer's Institut fur Sozialforschung (the later ‘Frankfurter
      School’). In 1936 he wrote a major sociological study on the American
      unemployed movement for the Institute, although it remained in the
      Institute's files, to be published only in 1969 by the SDS publishing
      house Neue Kritik.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">After the United States' entry into the Second World War and the
      consequent persecution campaign directed against the entire critical
      intelligentsia, the left in America was liquidated by Macarthyism. Mattick
      retired, at the beginning of the 50’ies, to the countryside, where he
      managed to survive through occasional jobs and his activity as a writer.
      In the postwar development Mattick - like others - made only small and
      occasional political activities, making small articles for various
      periodicals from time to time.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">From the 1940’s and up through the 1950’s Mattick went through a study
      of Keynes, and compiled a series of critical notes and articles against
      Keynesian theory and practice. In this work he developed Marx’s and
      Grossman's theory of capitalist development further to meet the new
      phenomena and appearances of the modern capitalism critically.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">With the general changes of the political scenes and the re-emergence of
      more radical thoughts in the 1960’s Paul Mattick made some more
      elaborated and important contributions. One main work was ‘<i>Marx and
      Keynes. The Limits of the Mixed Economy</i>’ from 1969, which was
      translated into several languages and had quite an influence in the
      post-68 student movement. Another important work was ‘Critique of
      Herbert Marcuse - The one-dimensional man in class society’, in which
      Mattick forcefully rejected the thesis according to which the
      &quot;proletariat,&quot; as Marx understood it had become a
      &quot;mythological concept&quot; in advanced capitalist society. Although
      he agreed with Marcuse's critical analysis of the ruling ideology, Mattick
      demonstrated that the theory of one dimensionality itself existed only as
      ideology. Marcuse subsequently affirmed that Mattick's critique was the
      only serious one to which his book was subjected.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">Up through the 1970’s a lot of old and new articles were published in
      different languages for various publications. In the academic year
      1974-75, Mattick was engaged as ‘visiting professor’ at the ‘red’
      University-Center of Roskilde in Denmark. Here he held lectures on Marx’
      critique of political economy, on the history of the workers movement and
      served as critical co-referent at seminars with other guests such as
      Maximilian Rubel, Ernest Mandel, Joan Robinson a.o. In 1977 he completed
      his last important lecture tour of the University of Mexico City. He spoke
      in West Germany only twice; in 1971 at Berlin and in 1975 at Hanover.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">In his last years Paul Mattick thus succeeded in getting some audience
      within new generations for his views. In 1978 a major collection of
      articles from over 40 years appeared as ‘Anti-Bolshevik Communism.’</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font size="2">Paul Mattick died in February 1981 leaving an almost finished manuscript
      for another book, which was later edited and published by his son, Paul
      Mattick Jr., as ‘Marxism – Last Refuge of the Bourgeoisie ?’</font></p>
